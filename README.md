# .emacs
Here is my emacs configuration, in order to use it, clone the repository and rename the emacs file and the emacs_files folder by ading a '.' at the begining.
Then you will have to download some package manually when you will first open your emacs with it.
To do it you will just have to use alt + x follow by the package-refresh-content. After that you will be able to do alt + x follow by package-install, enter and then the package name.
You will have to do it with each package of this list : drag_stuff, rainbow_delimiter, auto_complete, which_key.
